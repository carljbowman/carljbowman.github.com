			<h1>Temporal Tarsier</h1>
			<p>The Tarsier's enormous eyes can be up to 16mm across and enable the Tarsier to hunt for prey and watch out for predators in the dark. Scientists are still unsure of the effects of two Tarsiers enter a starring contest; speculations have been made that this event could cause a rift in the time space continuum. This ritual is currently being explored by top researchers as a basis for time travel. No government has released a official information for this research; leaked sources have reported code names such as <em>Operation Stare Bear</em>, <em>Project Peer Primate</em>, and most notable <em>Fuzzy Fissure Fusion</em>. Experiments have been executed under similar parameters as the <a href= "http://science.howstuffworks.com/atom-smasher2.htm">Particle Accelerator</a>: in which two Tarsiers are placed at opposing end with eyes locked. From this point the subjects are slowly brought closer together. Leaked reports suggest at 10 feet beams of light lock the two into what is described as &ldquo;the eternal staring contest.&rdquo; Synchronized song has been recorded during testing, but not released to the public.</p>

			<h1>Mustache Monkey</h1>
			<p>The Emperor tamarin was named because of it's elegant white moustache, which is thought to resemble that of German emperor Wilhelm II. Monkey Mustache Envy (MME) is a common psychological disorder among monkey culture; monocles were recently issued to other primates compensate for an embalance in classiness. Recents polls on MME have indicated that pipes and top hats are now the talk of the tree gathering communities. The current issue of Monkey Money Monthly (MMM), famed economic report, named the Emperor Tamarin as the main influence behind recent vogue trends. New reports show a rise in stocks like Canopy Cash and Bark Bucks.</p>
