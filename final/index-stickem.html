						<p>Both the installation and book pose a question about the media cycle looking to examine relationship between insurmountable numbers and their relationship to the individual. No longer do we hear about the BP Oil spill even after two years; a spill that bled a total of 39 million gallons of oil. Now compare that with the 46 year old spill of Torrey Canyon which leaked 38 million gallons of oil. A spill 1 million gallons smaller and a half decade old still plagues it's environment leaving entire rock quarries full of oil.

						<p>Inspired by the works and writing of Jared Diamond, this project sought to look at the nine past societies and their detrimental habits, addictions, and flaws leading to their inevitable collapse. <br><br>
The first half of the project is 
a book dissecting key societal issues withing the overall system of downfall. Then relates those flaws to relevant current global problems we are facing today.

As a designer it is hard not to be inspired by the prolific works of Ray and Charles Eames. This project is an homage to their remarkable chair designs.<br><br>
Alluding to other works by Eames such as the Power of Ten, this piece explores their process in a scaled manner The choice to score the piece with a modern up beat tempo relating to their timeless quality and their works relevance both in art and design.<br>
